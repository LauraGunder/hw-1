	<h3>Dancing and music cures everything and anything!</h3>
    
    <p>Music is the most important thing in my life. I think without music people would not be able to function. Music powers people in so many forms. It has the ability to connect people. It can express feeling that humans may not even understand or know they have.</p>

    <h3><strong>Favorite things to do in NYC</strong></h3>
        
    <p> Hang out in Brooklyn grabbing brunch or dancing the night away. Lower East side for good live music and food and bars! 
      Spending time at riverside, I love anything that you can do outside because it's free :). They West Village is one of the best
      places to wonder around in just getting lost in the shops. There really is no city like NYC!
